# dp-display
Tools to allow reading of data from closing of DPReview.com forums

Dp-display (index.html) is a local web page that allows you to drag-and-drop your DPReview message dump (if you requested your data from DPR) and present the messages in a more human-readable format.

## How to use:

- Either download index.html, or go to https://avidgamefan.github.io/dp-display/
- Drag and drop your forum-posts.json file or the whole zip file as received from dpreview into the box. Or you could upload them with the button under the box.
- From the list of displayed topics, choose which batch of messages you want displayed
    (It may take several seconds for it to unpack the data)
- Scroll down or use the search to see your messages and quoted info.

## Limitations:

- There could be better formatting.
- Readers have not been created for the other .json files, only forum-posts.json.
- Only forum-posts.json is currently supported. Support is needed for the other .json files
